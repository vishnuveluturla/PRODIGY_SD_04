# Sudoku Solver

## Description
The Sudoku Solver is a Java program designed to solve Sudoku puzzles using backtracking algorithm. Given an incomplete Sudoku board as input, the solver attempts to fill in the empty cells with digits from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains no duplicate digits. If a solution exists, the program prints the solved Sudoku board; otherwise, it notifies the user that no solution was found.

## Features
- Solve Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels.
- Utilizes a backtracking algorithm for efficient solution finding.
- Input Sudoku board is represented as a 9x9 integer array.
- Provides a clear and concise command-line interface for ease of use.
